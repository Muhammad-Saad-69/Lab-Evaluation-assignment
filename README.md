## Purpose of the Code

This project is a simple implementation of Stack and Queue data structures using Linked Lists. It is created solely for the purpose of completing an academic assignment.

## Features

- **Stack Implementation**:

  - Push operation
  - Pop operation
  - Peek operation
  - Check if the stack is empty

- **Queue Implementation**:

  - Enqueue operation
  - Dequeue operation
  - Peek operation
  - Check if the queue is empty

 ## Stack Documentation
  
- **Overview**:
  - A stack follows the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle. Elements are added to and removed from the top.
 
  - **Methods**:
    - **push(value)**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    - **pop()**: Removes and returns the top element. Returns "Stack is empty" if the stack is empty.
    - **peek()**: Returns the top element without removing it. Returns "Stack is empty" if empty.
    - **isEmpty()**: Checks if the stack is empty.
    - **stackSize()**: Returns the size of the stack
    - **displayStack()**: Displays all elements in the stack from top to bottom.

 ## Queue Documentation
  
- **Overview**:
  - A queue follows the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle. Elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.
 
  - **Methods**:
    - **enqueue(element)**: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
    - **dequeue()**: Removes and returns the element from the front. Returns "Queue is empty" if the queue is empty.
    - **peek()**: Returns the front element without removing it. Returns "Queue is empty" if empty.
    - **isEmpty()**: Checks if the queue is empty.
    - **size()**: Returns the size of the queue.
    - **displayQueue()**: Displays all elements in the queue from front to rear.

## Time Complexity

### Stack

- **Push**: O(1)
- **Pop**: O(1)
- **Peek**: O(1)

### Queue

- **Enqueue**: O(1)
- **Dequeue**: O(1)
- **Peek**: O(1)
